## Scenario A
bona fide reference materials

### Subscenarios

#### u

The manufacturer supplies a “standard error” or “standard uncertainty” 
(abbreviated by lowercase “u”) or “combined standard uncertainty” 
(often denoted by “u C ”)

#### Uk

The manufacturer supplies an “expanded uncertainty”
(abbreviated by uppercase “U”) for the TV, then either the
“coverage factor” (abbreviated by “k”)

#### Ucoverage

The manufacturer supplies an “expanded uncertainty”
(abbreviated by uppercase “U”) for the TV, then either the
coverage

#### lowerupper
The manufacturer reports the lower and upper limits of a 95%
or 99% confidence interval (CI) for the TV

## Scenario B
If the reference material has a TV determined by PT
consensus results, then both an SD (identified as SD RM ) based on
these results and the number of laboratories reporting (identified as
nLab) should also be available.

## Scenario C
If the reference material has a TV determined by peer
group results from an interlaboratory QC program, set se RM and N RM
as described above for the PT scenario.

## Scenario D
If the TV represents a conventional quantity value

## Scenario E
When working with a commercial QC material supplied
with a TV for which the standard error cannot be estimated
